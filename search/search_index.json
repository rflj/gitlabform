New major releases of GitLabForm starting with v2 will look for <code>config_version</code> key in the config file. If it doesn't exist, or the version does not match expected then the app will exit to avoid applying unexpected configuration and allowing the user to update the configuration. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>New config syntax (breaking change). All 3 levels under a common key <code>projects_and_groups</code>. It should contain a dict, where common config is under a special <code>\"*\"</code> key, group configs under keys like <code>group/*</code> and project configs under keys like <code>group/project</code>. This will allow introducing pattern matching in these keys and introducing support for multiple config files in the future releases. Partially implements #138.

Note that you can restore the old behaviour by running the app with <code>(...) || true</code>. Also standardized exit codes. Exit with 1 in case of input error (f.e. config file does not exist), with 2 in case of processing error (f.e. GitLab returns HTTP 500).Fixes #153. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow any case in groups and projects names (breaking change). GitLab groups and projects names are case sensitive but you cannot create such entities that differ only in the case. There is also a distinction between a \"name\" and a \"path\" and they may differ in case... To make work with this easier GitLabForm now accepts any case for them in both config files as well as when provided as command line arguments. We also disallow such entities that differ only in case (f.e. <code>group/*</code> and <code>GROUP/*</code>) to avoid ambiguity. Fixes #160. (RC2)</p> </li> <li> <p>Ignore archived projects by default (breaking change). This makes processing faster and output shorter. You can restore the previous behavior by adding <code>--include-archived-projects</code>/<code>-a</code> command line switch. Note that you have to do it if you want to unarchive archived projects! Fixes #157 in (arguably) a more convenient way. (RC2)</p> </li> <li> <p>Color output! Implements #141. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Add diffing feature for secret variables. (with values shown as hashes to protect the secrets from leaking). (RC6)</p> </li> <li> <p>Added checking for invalid syntax in \"members\" section. Defining groups or users directly under this key instead of under sub-keys \"users\" and \"groups\" will now trigger an immediate error.

Deduplicate a lot of the boilerplate code, allow putting configs into the test methods and use pytest fixtures for easier setup and cleanup. This should fix issues with tests reported in #190.
